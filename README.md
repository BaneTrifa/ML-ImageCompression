# ML-ImageCompression

## Description 
The goal of this project is to implement image compression with the help of K means algorithms.

K-Means algorithm is a centroid based clustering technique. This technique cluster the dataset into k different clusters. Each cluster in the k-means clustering algorithm is represented by its centroid point.

## Running
Place all input images (images that you want to compress) in the 'in_img' directory and run 'main.py'. After the execution of 'main.py', the compressed input images will be in the 'out_img' directory. 

All input images need to be in RGB format.

Note: Execution may take a while depending on the size of the image.

## Results

The results you can see in the out_img directory.
